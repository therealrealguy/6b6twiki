# 2019

`6b6t` was born in March of this year. During its early stages, it had a small player base ranging from 5-20 players and would sometimes get over 30 players. The server was premium only.

6b6t originally gained it's notoriety for having the [Chunkr/Crafting Dupe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cEHj0TGzYU) along with a wide array of illegal items created by user 'TheTroll2001'. Many players alleged him to have paid Leee for operator status, while others just considered him a server administrator who happened to abuse his powers. However, the true reasoing for his unrestrained admin access is unknown.

6b6t had one notable surge in popularity throughout July of 2019 when almost all anarchy servers blew up in Taiwan, and it was given another significant boost of players when 3b3t (a server largely affected by the new Taiwanese players) temporarily shut down due to filespace limits being reached due to the surge in activity. 6b6t reached highs of 50 players at this time and possibly more during peak hours in Taiwan. However in a few weeks the numbers deflated back to normal.

Throughout 2019, Leee, 0b0t's players and staff had much conflict, such as `0b0t` players joining `6b6t` to crash, lag or bot the server. This conflict would go on until June of [2020](./2020.md). `6b6t` was a premium server until Leee launched a cracked server sometime in late `2019` under the subdomain `cracked.6b6t.org` which did not get many players.

The map was also reset multiple times over the course of this year because of many reasons, some of them are unknown.
Reasons:
* Late 2019
  * The server machine lost power which caused all region files to corrupt.
  * All of the files lost to a hard drive failure, no backups were taken.
* November:
  * Something caused the map to corrupt
