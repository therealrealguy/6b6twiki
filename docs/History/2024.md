# 2024

In the beginning of this year there was an illegals event which allowed people to place bedrock causing many builds that are still there to this day.

**NOTE:** All of qbasty's messages reported here were sent on the announcements channel of the official 6b6t discord

[qbasty](../Players/qbasty.md) made the following announcement:
> 6b6t is for sale. I have been thinking about this for a while and it's time for me to work on something else. I've been running anarchy servers since 2021. I have still many great ideas to take this server to thousands of players and long lifetime so it doesn't shut down, but I believe I'm not gonna be the one to take it there. I would love to help someone take the server there by still being involved few days per month. Please DM me with your offers, I won't give you the price so just tell me your best price at the start, be serious, I'm sure I'll receive **a lot** of requests, 6b6t is not only the biggest anarchy server in the world, it's also the one that generates the most revenue after 2b2t (not profit, because we reinvest everything and put in additionally our own money, it's possible for the server to be profitable but we chose growth and updates instead of profit).
> I'll sell the server to the person that not offers just the most, but is also the best person to take over.
> My DMs are open. I'll make sure the server continues running and you can still have fun, so no worries. ❤️ 👑 Have a nice day everyone.

In this announcement he stated that he wants to work on something else and that he will make sure that the server keeps running.

@everyone
LISTEN UP motherfuckers
If I dont sell the server within exactly 14 days
Im sending this fucking shit to the abyss
Domains? GONE
Discord? GONE
ALL OF IT
Just gonna renew shit for 10 years and send it to an account I can never access
GONE
Let me enable emojis lmao
Yea so fuck this shit, just gonna send to the best person, dont give a fuck about money, it can be $10 or $10k
*sell
In case we go to the abyss, Xymb will probably host the map somwhere because hes fucking obsessed with keeping shit online
But the domains? The name? Branding? GONE?
Have a nice day
Love
only dm me with bids, dont fucking ask how much is it, and dont ask how much it costs to run, FIGURE IT OUT
@everyone happy saturday
I'm gonna make sure the following:
1) player data is safe - of course the passwords and emails and usernames, etc., but that inventories and /home's etc will remain the same as well
2) online 24/7
3) cracked
4) same map
5) owner not a retard

!
And all VIPs etc are keeping their ranks 100% and all downgrades ill go through it, if shit goes sideways ill just refund everyone that purchased in the last 6 months (automatically) (ranks changing too much (in the negative way) from what you paid for) and those that request additionally will also get their money back
don't give a fuck about money, gotta be fair to the supporters, if i needed money i would have sold the server months ago 
why is discord GAY with these emojis?
not selling because i need to for some reason, videogames are just gay ig

still gonna make sure you can enjoy playing
Btw to all broke paypal monkeys, the server isnt for sale for anything less than 4 figures (in the upper end)
qbasty — 05/18/2024 11:02 PM
if I would be a patient motherfucker I can scrap this shit for pieces and sell everything over a long time for 5 figures
Someone will sell their organs sooner or later for 8b8t.org

💀 LMAO
