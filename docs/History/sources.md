[8b8t.me wiki - The 6b6t era](https://wiki.8b8t.me/index.php?title=History#:~:text=6b6t.org%20/%206b6t.co%20Era%20(March%202019%20to%20January%202021),-The%206b6t%20era)

# Original (Discord) messages on 6b6t wiki's server
# DSNS's version
According to the website, `6b6t` was created in 2022 but according to DSNS it was created atleast before July 2019, the time when Leeewith3Es was the owner and DSNS joined, proof is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaW-yZpxiqk) YouTube ad released on July 18th 2019. The server was kinda active, nowhere near the player count it is today.<br/>There was a bunch of admin abuse, the user `TheTroll2001` had OP perms.<br/>
The `6b6t` domain was actually taken from Leee without his permission.<br/>
He explained it in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQfO_RxcHxI), Leee went on to create `6b6t.co`.<br/>
DSNS quit the server for a while so someone needs to fill in the info after Leee sold it.<br/>
It seems to this day he doesn't like qbasty or `6b6t`.
I also think that qbasty reset the server/world jan 16, 2022, the day it started (according to the website)

# Original text by DSNS (Discord: dsns)
- i can try to fill you guys with information about 6b
- the first thing is that the current `6b6t` website is lying, `6b6t` is much older than 2022, it was actually created at least before july 2019.

- i believe Leeewith3E was the owner during 2019, when i first joined the server
- he released an ad for `6b6t` july 18 2019 on his channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaW-yZpxiqk
![Leee 6b6t ad](https://6b6t-wiki.vercel.app/vids/Leee/2b2t%20the%20best%202b2t%20clone%206b6t.org%20-%20Leee.mp4)
- the server was kinda active, nowhere near the player count it is today
![Leee 6b6t.co is the real 6b6t and the truth about bleepo vid](https://6b6t-wiki.vercel.app/img/Screenshots/leee%20vid.png)
- there was a bunch of admin abuse, thetroll2001 had OP perms
- i think the `6b6t` domain was actually taken from leee without his permission 
- he explained it in this video, leee went on to create `6b6t.co` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQfO_RxcHxI
- ofc take his word with a grain of salt
- actually here is a description by lee himself https://wiki.8b8t.me/index.php?title=History#:~:text=6b6t.org%20/%206b6t.co%20Era%20(March%202019%20to%20January%202021),-The%206b6t%20era  

### North later replied to the second message
- <ins>North</ins>: leee made the server because someone else bought 0b0t after the domain expired, after that it was passed to bleepo in 2020
- <ins>DSNS</ins>: yea the wiki post i linked has pretty much everything
- <ins>North</ins>: oldfag had stuff to do with 6b as well https://oldfagdotorg.fandom.com/wiki/6b6t.org
- <ins>North</ins>: I think I still have a world download of spawn from 2020 6b

# Original text by firey and vined
vined's discord: `vined_`<br/>firey's discord: `hi.im.firy.if.u.read.dis.u.cool`

it all started when qb abandoned oa and said 6b would surpass 2b by miles<br/>
it did get alot of players it kept a steady 100-150 playerbase for a while then theres this two cool guys called normal cat and cipher<br/>
cat was a previous owner of 6b<br/>
and cipher was an admin<br/>
when the server got reworked both of them got backstabbed by qb by stripping them of their roles<br/>
then they tried to expose this admin on 6b called hop for being a pedophile<br/>
and pistonmaster stepped in and defended the so called pedophile<br/>
so cipher called piston out also for defending a literal pedo<br/>
both got banned and they made a server<br/>
in discord<br/>
to talk about gathering evidence to expose 6b cause at that time<br/>
qb was talking to a guy<br/>
and said he would give him money to get 6b botted<br/>
but in the end qb never paid so the guy stopped botting and started to join cipher and cat<br/>
also the downfall of 6b was also caused by retarded decisions<br/>
also there was this one time 6b went below 0.1 tps and it got so unplayable<br/>
chat started to get spammed like crazy<br/>
they made it so you can pay for higher dupe chances<br/>
and like that was really not cool so the community started to get mad cause its p2w<br/>
but qb did eventually revert the changes<br/>
after cipher and cat broke off 6b qb hired randos like ollie and nixter17<br/>
he got later doxxed by thetroll2001  and left `6b6t` because he admin abused <br/>
didnt ollie leave 6b cause he wasnt being paid<br/>
by qb and he got tired of his shit<br/>
that and because also what happened with nixter<br/>
