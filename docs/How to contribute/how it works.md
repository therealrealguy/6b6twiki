# How this works
This website was built in such a way that creating a markdown file in the docs folder will make a new entry in the sidebar. Making a new folder makes a new dropdown in the sidebar and making a new markdown file in that folder makes an entry in that folder's dropdown. You can modify folders and files by cloning the [GitHub](https://github.com/therealrealguy/6b6twiki/) repository.

## What are markdown files ?
They end in .md
Markdown is kinda like HTML because it lets you edit the way text looks like you can make a text **bold** *italic* <ins>underlined</ins> and much more. Learn more in [this tutorial i found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PPWWRV6gbA&t=60s)

## I have made changes to a file locally then what ?
Make a pull request to the GitHub repository, if it gets accepted it will get pushed merged with the project and automatically built and deployed (if there aren't errors in the build) on vercel, if it gets rejected, well, it doesnt get merged with the project.
